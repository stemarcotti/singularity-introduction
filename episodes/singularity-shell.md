::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Learn how to run different commands when starting a container.
- Learn how to open an interactive shell within a container environment.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How do I run different commands within a container?
- How do I access an interactive shell within a container?

## Running specific commands within a container

We saw earlier that we can use the `singularity inspect` command to see the run script that a container is configured to run by default. What if we want to run a different command within a container?

If we know the path of an executable that we want to run within a container, we can use the `singularity exec` command. For example, using the `hello-world.sif` container that we've already pulled from Singularity Hub, we can run the following within the `test` directory where the `hello-world.sif` file is located:

```bash
$ singularity exec hello-world.sif /bin/echo Hello World!
```

```output
Hello World!
```

Here we see that a container has been started from the `hello-world.sif` image and the `/bin/echo` command has been run within the container, passing the input `Hello World!`. The command has echoed the provided input to the console and the container has terminated.

Note that the use of `singularity exec` has overriden any run script set within the image metadata and the command that we specified as an argument to `singularity exec` has been run instead.

## Basic exercise: Running a different command within the "hello-world" container

Can you run a container based on the `hello-world.sif` image that **prints the current date and time**?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```bash
$ singularity exec hello-world.sif /bin/date
```

```output
Fri Jun 26 15:17:44 BST 2020
```

#### **The difference between `singularity run` and `singularity exec`**

Above we used the `singularity exec` command. In earlier episodes of this
course we used `singularity run`. To clarify, the difference between these
two commands is:

- `singularity run`: This will run the default command set for containers
  based on the specfied image. This default command is set within
  the image metadata when the image is built (we'll see more about this
  in later episodes). You do not specify a command to run when using
  `singularity run`, you simply specify the image file name. As we saw
  earlier, you can use the `singularity inspect` command to see what command
  is run by default when starting a new container based on an image.

- `singularity exec`: This will start a container based on the specified
  image and run the command provided on the command line following
  `singularity exec <image file name>`. This will override any default
  command specified within the image metadata that would otherwise be
  run if you used `singularity run`.

## Opening an interactive shell within a container

If you want to open an interactive shell within a container, Singularity provides the `singularity shell` command. Again, using the `hello-world.sif` image, and within our `test` directory, we can run a shell within a container from the hello-world image:

```bash
$ singularity shell hello-world.sif
```

```output
Singularity> whoami
[<your username>]
Singularity> ls
hello-world.sif
Singularity> 
```

As shown above, we have opened a shell in a new container started from the `hello-world.sif` image. Note that the shell prompt has changed to show we are now within the Singularity container.

## Comparing Singularity commands and Docker commands

**To run a container:**

```bash
$ singularity run hello-world.sif
```

```bash
$ docker container run hello-world
```

**To run a specific command using a container:**

```bash
$ singularity exec hello-world.sif /bin/echo Hello World!
```

For Docker this depends on the container.
Some, like the `alpine` container, are set up for you to run your own commands directly:
```bash
docker container run alpine cat /etc/os-release
```

For others, you will need to override the default entrypoint:
```bash
$ docker container run -it --entrypoint /bin/date hello-world
```

**To run a shell inside a container:**

```bash
$ singularity shell hello-world.sif
```

```bash
$ docker container run -it --entrypoint bash hello-world
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  discussion

## Discussion: Running a shell inside a Singularity container

Q: What do you notice about the output of the above commands entered within the Singularity container shell?

Q: Does this differ from what you might see within a Docker container?


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Use the `exit` command to exit from the container shell.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The `singularity exec` is an alternative to `singularity run` that allows you to start a container running a specific command.
- The `singularity shell` command can be used to start a container and run an interactive shell within it.
